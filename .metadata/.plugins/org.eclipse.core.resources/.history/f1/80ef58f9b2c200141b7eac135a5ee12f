If there is a rock or flower two spaces in front of the jumper, the jumper moves to the spot, destoys the object that was there, and adds red flowers extending out from that 
location in all 4 vertical and horizontal directions, destroying everything in the grid until it reaches the edge of the grid or 10 spaces on an unbounded grid.

If the jumper is facing a direction that has a nonexistent location two spots ahead, it goes forwards one space,
 it turns 90 degrees right and jumps one space that direction all at once.

If the jumper is facing the edge of the grid one space away it removes itself from the grid.

If the jumper is facing a direction with an actor two spots ahead of it, the actor is removed from the grid, the jumper lands in the spot the actor was in,
 and leaves rocks in the 8 spots around the jumper, or as many as 
it possibly can if the actor is next to an edge, removing anything around the destroyed actor.

If a jumper is facing another jumper two spots away, both jumpers turn 90 degress to the right and a new jumper 
that's color is the average of the RGB values of the two original bugs and is facing south is created in the spot
 between the two bugs. Anything in the way is destroyed.
